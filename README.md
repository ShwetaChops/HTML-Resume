# HTML-Resume

Program that takes a resume in a simplistic text file and convert it into an HTML file that can be displayed by a web browser.

The resume text file follows certain predefined patterns in how the Name, Email Address, Projects and Courses will be mentioned. Thus the program uses these patterns to accurately detect chunks of the resume body.
